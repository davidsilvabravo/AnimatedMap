- Title of the project: Real Time Bus Tracker
- Description of the project: on this project I used the original "Real Time Bus Tracker" and modified it to revert the movement, used pacman instead of basic marker, and made it "eat" the fruits on the road.
- How to Run: you just need to download all files of the repository, and open index.html on a browser. Then click on the button.
- Roadmap of future improvements: not planned.
- License information: MIT license.
